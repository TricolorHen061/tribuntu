# Tribuntu

Tribuntu was the first Discord good bot I made. To run Tribuntu on your computer, please make the following files in the same directory you cloned this repository in:

`disabled_logging.json`
`disabled_servers.json`
`levelups_disabled.json`
`levelups.json`
`meme_channels.json`
`prefixes.json`
`userfeedback.txt`
`warned_members.json`

and make a folder named `music`

then run `python3 tribuntu.py`. The code is very inefficient since when I was making it, I was a beginner to programming. If you wish to make the code more efficient, please make a push request and I can add it to the file. If you have any questions, please join the server https://discord.gg/qNRNw6s.
