# Tribuntu

Tribuntu was the first Discord good bot I made. To run Tribuntu on your computer, please open the `tribuntu.py` file and edit the variables towrds the top of the file to your likings and then run `python3 tribuntu.py` in the directory the file is in. The code is very inefficient since when I was making it, I was a beginner to programming. If you wish to make the code more efficient, please make a push request and I can add it to the file. If you have any questions, please join the server https://discord.gg/qNRNw6s.
